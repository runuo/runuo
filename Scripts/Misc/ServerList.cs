		 * The default setting for Address, a value of 'null', will use your local IP address. If all of your local IP addresses
		 * are private network addresses and AutoDetect is 'true' then RunUO will attempt to discover your public IP address
		 * for you automatically.
		 *
		 * If you do not plan on allowing clients outside of your LAN to connect, you can set AutoDetect to 'false' and leave
		 * Address set to 'null'.
		 * 
		 * If your public IP address cannot be determined, you must change the value of Address to your public IP address
		 * manually to allow clients outside of your LAN to connect to your server. Address can be either an IP address or
		 * a hostname that will be resolved when RunUO starts.
		 * 
		 * If you want players outside your LAN to be able to connect to your server and you are behind a router, you must also
		 * forward TCP port 2593 to your private IP address. The procedure for doing this varies by manufacturer but generally
		 * involves configuration of the router through your web browser.
		 *
		 * ServerList will direct connecting clients depending on both the address they are connecting from and the address and
		 * port they are connecting to. If it is determined that both ends of a connection are private IP addresses, ServerList
		 * will direct the client to the local private IP address. If a client is connecting to a local public IP address, they
		 * will be directed to whichever address and port they initially connected to. This allows multihomed servers to function
		 * properly and fully supports listening on multiple ports. If a client with a public IP address is connecting to a
		 * locally private address, the server will direct the client to either the AutoDetected IP address or the manually entered
		 * IP address or hostname, whichever is applicable. Loopback clients will be directed to loopback.
		 * 
		 * If you would like to listen on additional ports (i.e. 22, 23, 80, for clients behind highly restrictive egress
		 * firewalls) or specific IP adddresses you can do so by modifying the file SocketOptions.cs found in this directory.
